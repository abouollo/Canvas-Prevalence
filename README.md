# Canvas-Prevalence

This repository includes the source code of a scrapping script that is used to calculate the percentage of websites using Canvas, which was executed as part of the research "Canvas Fingerprinting: A State of the Art". 

The script takes a CSV file with the list of websites (which you wish to check if they use Canvas) as input. The input file should be in this format:

1,google.com

2,youtube.com

3,facebook.com
